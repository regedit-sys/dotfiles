for arch | it's a zip because FACK YOU!!

----

apps needed:
```
rofi kitty polybar openbox xorg
```

these can be found in the default pacman repos.

i'm assuming you know how to extract a zip in the commandline (i'd be suprised if you dont)

throw the files into `~/.config` and you're done (after you install packages)
